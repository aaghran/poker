Hand Evaluationmake array of size 13 so that we can use it as indexes to compare the cardswhichever rankâ€™s card it finds increments value at that indexdetermining a pairint sameCards: records how many cards are of the same rank, int groupRank: holds the rank of the pairafter getting all pairscompare ranks of each pair(NOTE: if we find three of a kind,we overwrite samecards taking it prior than the pair)compare and evaluate the higher rank hand// therefore this code is used to determine a pair, 2 pair, three of a kind, four of a kind, and a full house.
